## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to compile earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API an effort to design interactive maps of incidents around the world. The map was designed with three different layers: all earthquakes, major earthquakes as well as tectonic plates. Additionally, the map was designed with three different viewing capabilities: satellite, street and dark.
